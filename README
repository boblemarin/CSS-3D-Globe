This project is a simple experiment intended to benchmark the performance of hardware accelerated 3D transforms using CSS in WebKit browsers.

At this point, it looks rather promising (IMHO).

The page can be viewed in Chrome, Safari and Safari Mobile.

When objects become too numerous :
- Chrome does not display more than 300(? - hardware related) and hides the rest

- Safari tries to display everything, but the framerate suffers

- Safari Mobile does pretty well, but craches above a certain (not stable) limit.
The page made my iPad 2 reboot this morning.
